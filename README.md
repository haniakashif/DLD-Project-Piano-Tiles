# DLD-Project-Piano-Tiles
This repo contains the code for our DLD project from Spring semester 2023. The game uses 2 FSMs. One FSM is for the random number generation that helps select the lane in which tile will be generated. The other FSM is the main game FSM which has 3 states, menuscreen, gameplay, and endscreen. We tried to import a gameover picture for the game end screen, but were unsuccessful, so the gameover modules are currently not working. We will try to fix that code so that we are able to display the game end screen as a picture. The scoring has been displayed on the seven segment display, and we will try to display the score on screen. We will also try to incorporate music using either an arduino or by frequency modulation.
